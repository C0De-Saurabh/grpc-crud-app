# gRPC CRUD App in Go

This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using gRPC in Go. It demonstrates the use of gRPC and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for efficient communication in a microservices architecture.

## Features

- **gRPC** for communication between client and server.
- **Protocol Buffers** for efficient data serialization.
- Basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- Clean and scalable directory structure.


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grpc-crud-app.git
cd grpc-crud-app
```
### 2. Generate gRPC Code from Proto File

Ensure you have `protoc` and the Go gRPC plugins installed.

```bash
protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. pb/todo.proto
```

### 3. Run the gRPC Server

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

### 4. Testing with Postman

You can test the gRPC service using Postman as follows:

1. **Open Postman** and create a new gRPC request.

2. **Import the Proto File:**
   - Click on **Import** in the top-left corner.
   - Select **File** and upload your `todo.proto` file.

3. **Setup the gRPC Request:**
   - Enter your server address (e.g., `localhost:50051`) in this case its default to `localhost:8080`.
   - Choose the gRPC method you want to test from the list generated by Postman based on your `proto` file (e.g., `CreateTodo`, `GetTodo`, etc.).

4. **Define the Request Body:**
   - For methods like `CreateTodo`, `UpdateTodo`, etc., provide the required fields in the request body according to the protobuf definitions.
   - Example for `CreateTodo`:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "1",
       "title": "Sample Todo",
       "description": "This is a sample todo item."
     }
     ```

5. **Send the Request:**
   - Click on the **Send** button to make the gRPC request to your server.
   - Review the response in the Postman window to ensure your service is working as expected.

By using Postman, you can easily test your gRPC methods and verify the functionality of your service.
